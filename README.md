# Chat4Us - Cross-Platform Chat Bots Creator

Chat4Us is a lightweight open-source cross-platform chat bots creator that anyone can use to design chat flows, from static Q/A to AI-driven discussions and when needed human chat escalation through the messenger app.
Chatbots can be created and designed using a visual interface in even the most basic to advanced configurations, utilizing scripting capabilities to address special scenarios such as local/remote data management and continuous discussion monitoring and moderation.
Chat flows can be connected either to local/offline LLMs using GPT4All or external APIs providers like OpenAI, DeepSeek or Groq.
